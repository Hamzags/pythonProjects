Hello!

My name is Hamza Gassi I am a python/reactjs developer out of Montreal,Canada
and this is a portfolio of python programs I developed myself. 

These projects were developed by myself solely with no outside assistance besides google and the python.org library.

As you go through the different files in my portfolio you will notice an improvement not only in efficiency but in logic as you go through my most recent projects.
I chose to keep the original files and not rewrite the code to show myself and my future employer that I have the ability to learn and adapt as my skill level and experience grows.

I hope you will enjoy going through these programs as much as I enjoyed programming them!
