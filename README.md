# PythonProjects

A portfolio of python programs I developed.

As you go through the different files in my portfolio you will notice an improvement not only in efficiency but in logic as you go through my most recent projects.
I chose to keep the original files and not rewrite the code to show myself and my future employer that I have the ability to learn and adapt as my skill level and experience grows.
